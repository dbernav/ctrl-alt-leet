# Ctrl Alt Leet

A public log of my programming journey -- solving problems from Leetcode, Hackerrank, and elsewhere with a "problem-solving first" approach inspired by *Think Like a Programmer* by Anton V. Spraul.

# Who is this repo for?

1. New programmers who want clear solutions with explained reasoning
2. Recruiters curious about my problem solving style (contact me at emaildbernav@gmail.com)
3. Coders looking for working Leetcode/Hackerrank examples.

> Keep in mind - this repo will NOT contain answers in every language. It's about *how I approach problems* - not building a huge answer bank.

## How to read this repo:

### Folders
```
└───answers
    ├───easy
    │   ├───cpp
    │   └───python
    ├───hard
    └───medium
```

## File Naming Convention
{problem-name}{LC/HR}{wildcard}.{file-extension}

1. {problem-name} = the name of the problem as shown on the relevant site.
2. {LC/HR} = Leetcode/Hackerrank (or other sites, which I will update this README file to reflect)
3. {wildcard} = if the problems share a file extension but are in a different version (such as .py referring to Python 2 or 3), then I'll indicate it here - see the wildcard list below.
4. {file-extension} = I think we all know what this one is...you wouldn't run a Go file as a C++ file, for example.

Example:
'two-sumLC.py' -> Leetcode's "Two Sum" in Python 3 (default language)

## Wildcard List:
If there is no wildcard, assume the `default`. Otherwise, assume the specified version.

1. Python -> 'py2' for Python 2 | default = Python 3
2. C/C++ - 'c' for C | default = C++

## Languages
- Primary: Python 3, C++
- Secondary (eventually): C#, Go, Rust, (possibly Java and others)

### I hope that this repo is useful for whoever needs it! Thanks for reading this far. If you have any questions or want to contact me for work opportunities, shoot me an email at emaildbernav@gmail.com.
